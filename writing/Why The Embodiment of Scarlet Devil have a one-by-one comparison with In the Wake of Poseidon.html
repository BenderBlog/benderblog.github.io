    <h1>Why The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil have a one-by-one comparison with In the Wake of Poseidon?</h1>

    <p>Before reading: I wrote this during the summer vacation in the 2021, when I have nothing fun to do. To avoid embrass myself, I use English.</p>

    <h2>Basic Information 1</h2>
    <p>Music: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil Soundtrack</p>
    <p>Release in 2003 by ZUN for Team Shanghai Alice</p>
    <p>Genre: Stage Music, Jazz Fusion, Progressive Rock</p>
    <p>Personal Opinion: 3.5/5</p>
    <p>A lot better than Lizard by King Crimson, but not so impressive compared to The Snow Goose.</p>

    <h2>Basic Information 2</h2>
    <p>Music: In the Wake of the Poseidon</p>
    <p>Release in 1970 by King Crimson for E.G Records</p>
    <p>Genre: Jazz Rock, Progressive Rock</p>
    <p>Personal Opinion: 4/5</p>
    <p>Pretty similar to the Court of the Crimson King, but this is pretty impressive, too.</p>

    <h2>Why I thought it have a comparison with ItWoP? ---- Rename the Tracks.</h2>

    <h3>1. The Scarlet Dream - A Beginning (A Dream More Scarlet than Red) &lt;====&gt; Peace: A Beginning</h3>
    <p>In Poseidon album, there are three songs called "Peace", one for the beginning, one in the middle, one in the end. So yeah, this is the first.</p>
    <p>The "Peace: A Beginning" combines a peace and mysterious atomsphere, mainly by the Greg Lake's singing. As a comparison, this piece is pretty quiet, as an introduction.</p>

    <h3>2. Picture of the Girl (A Soul as Scarlet as a Ground Cherry) &lt;====&gt; Picture of a City</h3>
    <p>I know the theme of the song is a signifient difference from "Picture of a City". But come on, who knows the cute girl's complex and colouring dreaming?</p>
    <p>Picture of a City have a heavy jazz improvition, which means chaos. But this song is just a step by step introduction, which means order.</p>

    <h3>3. Mysterious Dreaming Night (Apparitions Stalk the Night) &lt;====&gt; 42nd At Treadmill</h3>
    <p>The theme of the song reminds me of the shining in the sky, what I saw when I was in countryside.</p>
    <p>42nd At Treadmill is the middle part of the Picture of a City, the lonely people in the nightless city.</p>

    <h3>4. I Talk to the Moon (Lunate Elf) &lt;====&gt; I Talk to the Wind / Cadence And Cascade</h3>
    <p>Yeah, the middle part of the music just like "I Talk to the Wind". Why moon? Because of the "Stars" and "Lunate" :-)</p>
    <p>Similar feel to the Cadence And Cascade, since we need a rest. (But the girls are so cute and curious.)</p>

    <h3>5. How Could You (Tomboyish Girl in Love) &lt;====&gt; No Comparison:-P</h3>
    <p>Since you like me, how could you treat me so bad?</p>

    <h3>6/7. Shanghai Scarlet Teahouse ~ Chinese Tea / Shanghai Alice of Meiji 17  &lt;====&gt; No Comparison:-P</h3>
    <p>I just can't come up a better name. Original writer successfully combines the Western and Eastern in the charactors and the music. But I changed "Meiji 17" to 1980, because for us, 1980 is a mass impact due to the Reforming and the Opening.</p>

    <h3>8. The Scarlet Dream - A Transition (Voile, the Magic Library) &lt;====&gt; Peace: A Theme</h3>
    <p>Second part of the "The Scarlet Dream". Just because the style is pretty much not the same from this on. And they are going to the library.</p>
    <p>Like "Peace: A Theme", the album needs a transition. Although it is earlier in this, rather than the Poseidon.</p>

    <h3>9. Dancing with The Crimson Wizard (Incl. Salute for Heroines) (Locked Girl ~ The Girl's Sealed Room) &lt;====&gt; In the Wake of the Poseidon (Including Libra's Theme)</h3>
    <p>This epic song reminds me of the "Dancing with The Moon Knight", and reminds a lot of Heroine and passions. It is the most prog-ish song in the album. The sturcture is complex enough, the theme is colourful, with rock, jazz and classical. And why "Crimson"? You could understand.</p>
    <p>Similar feel to "In the Wake of the Poseidon", epic theme, epic lyrics. The middle fast-riff part is named Salute for Heroines, as the middle part of the "In the Wake of the Poseidon" is named "Libra's Theme".</p>

    <h3>10. Spirit Madness (The Maid and the Pocket Watch of Blood) &lt;====&gt; Cat Food</h3>
    <p>Since Posidon have "Cat Food", which is nauthy and beyond understanding, here's Spirit Madness. What the spirit had done to make maid mad? Why the watch is full of blood? Why the human could stay in peace with the vampire? I don't want to know, I would rather go to hell to have a 'date' with Cyberdemon!</p>
    <p>"Cat Food" is pretty easy listening, not like this.</p>

    <h3>11. You Really Got Me (Lunar Clock ~ Luna Dial) &lt;====&gt; No Comparison:-P</h3>
    <p>The worst song of the album. I just can't stop thinking "You Really Got Me" riff.</p>

    <h3>12. Rise of the Scarlet Moon &lt;====&gt; 11 minute long instrumental inspired by Mars</h3>
    <p>Posidon have a suite called "Devil's Triangle". So this is a comparison, but the atmosphere is different from the root.</p>

    <h3>12.1 Encountering (The Young Descendant of Tepes) &lt;====&gt; The Devil's Triangle</h3>
    <p>Seems little relax, but there's something is going to happen, right:-P</p>
    <p>The Devil's Triangle is the first part, with drum and synth in the back. Which means the war between us and the land of Illusion due to their magic experience have a lot of negative effect in our city.</p>

    <h3>12.2 Wondering (Septette for a Dead Princess) &lt;====&gt; Merday Morn</h3>
    <p>In China, there's a folk called "Let's Swing the Oar" in the 1950s, the theme is similar to the that. And it's like wondering in the lake, enjoying sky, trees, and have fun. Basically a child would like that a little more.</p>
    <p>The Merday Morn is the middle part, means </p>

    <h3>12.3 Confusing (The Centennial Festival for Magical Girls) &lt;====&gt; Hand Of Sceiron</h3>
    <p>Strange days have come, they are looking for you to enjoy. Go to the "Strange Days" by The Doors. And why it is not finished, why there's so many toys and Alice in Wonderland?</p>

    <h3>12.4 Observing (U.N. Owen Was Her?) &lt;====&gt; Garden Of Worm</h3>
    <p>For the love sack, what does she observing from me? My knowledge or just myself? Oh dear.</p>

    <h3>16. The Scarlet Dream - A End (An Eternity More Transient than Scarlet) &lt;====&gt; Peace: An End</h3>
    <p>Finally, the mysterious tour comes to an end. Like "Peace - End", it reminds us the adventure.</p>
    <p>Peace is a word, from the sea and the wind~</p>

    <h3>17 What Happened (Scarlet Tower ~ Eastern Dream...) &lt;====&gt; Peace: An End</h3>
    <p>After you return home, you may wonder why they let you engage this adventure? I just want to listen to music, all right? Since there are so many work to do, you just pick up your book, and hope nothing would not happen... Or is it?</p>
